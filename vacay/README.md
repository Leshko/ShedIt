# Vacay — plan the family trip together

A social planner for a group vacation. One person starts a trip and gets a short
invite code; everyone else opens the link, types their name, and is in. No
accounts, no passwords.

What the family can do:

- **Home** — countdown, who's in, the current top-voted activities and restaurants,
  the latest wall post, and a live "what's happening" feed (who joined, who
  suggested what, who's in for what, who put what on the plan).
- **Stay** — the hotel / cabin / rental: photos, address with an embedded map and
  one-tap directions, check-in and check-out, the listing link, and notes for the
  family (door code, parking, who sleeps where).
- **Do** and **Eat** — two idea lists. Anyone can suggest; everyone votes ("I'm
  in"); the list sorts by votes; each idea has its own comment thread. Any idea
  can be dropped straight onto a day of the plan.
- **Plan** — a day-by-day itinerary generated from the trip dates. Add entries
  from the idea list or write your own, give them a time or leave them "anytime",
  and drag them between days.
- **Wall** — a shared message board with emoji reactions.

Screens poll every few seconds so everyone's phone stays in sync.

## Run it

```bash
cd vacay
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @vacay/web build     # once; the API serves the built app
pnpm --filter @vacay/api start     # http://localhost:3001
```

Data lives in a SQLite file at `api/data/vacay.sqlite`. Nothing else to set up.

### Develop

```bash
pnpm dev                           # API on :3001 with reload, Angular on :4200 with proxy
```

Open <http://localhost:4200>.

### Test

```bash
pnpm --filter @vacay/api test      # end-to-end API suite against an in-memory DB
```

## Layout

```
api/   NestJS 11 + TypeORM + SQLite. Trips, members, ideas, votes, comments,
       posts, activity feed, itinerary. Serves web/dist in production.
web/   Angular 20 (standalone, signals). Mobile-first; bottom tabs on phones,
       top tabs on desktop; light and dark.
```

### Environment

| Variable  | Default                 | Meaning                           |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `PORT`    | `3001`                  | API (and web) port                |
| `DB_PATH` | `api/data/vacay.sqlite` | SQLite file, or `:memory:`        |

### How access works

A trip has one invite code. Joining with a code and a name creates a member and
returns a bearer token the browser keeps in local storage. Joining again with the
same name on another device hands back the same identity, so Grandma can use her
phone and the iPad. The trip owner (whoever created it) can remove anyone's
ideas, comments and posts; everyone else can remove only their own.
